          Water pollution source tracking is a web application in which features like water pollution tracking, cause of water pollution, cure, consultants are provided
          <br>
          <br>
          Globally, the presence of drinking water without contamination within the 21st century is becoming a primary assignment. Worldwide regulating our bodies made up of the United Nations (UN) and the World Health Organization (WHO) have acknowledged the human right to safe, non-stop, secure and sufﬁcient body water and low-cost water for non-public and domestic use. According to WHO reports, 844 million human beings lack even a simple supplier of drinking water, which includes 159 million people relying on surface water [20]. Impure drinking water can lead to life-threatening diseases that include diarrhoea, cholera, dysentery, typhoid, and polio. The studies report alarmingly that diarrhoea alone causes about the loss of life of ﬁve lakh people every year. Hence diverse water parameters of high quality along with dissolved oxygen (DO), conductivity, pH, turbidity, and temperature must be controlled in real time. Recent times, however, water has faced challenges with the best tracking in real-time due to global warming conﬁned water assets, growing population etc. Subsequently, higher methodologies need to grow to reveal the water quality parameters in real time. Degrading water supplies have become normal in human distress. The traditional water quality control approaches include the guideline sequence of water trends form specific locations. Those water samples were examined using analytical techniques in the laboratory. These approaches are time consuming and not to be considered successful any more. water pollution source tracking web application must be expanded and designed which can monitor water. In this proposed - water quality parameters, water pollution tracking, causes and cures with consultants. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) by 2025, half of the inhabitants of the sector will live in water-scarce regions. This web can offer an awareness to water disasters for a growing country where human beings are not aware of pollutant amount in their water and that is why they are not aware of its health hazards. It would be very effective for them the usage of water is vast for not only for the urban people but also for the rural people.
          <br><br>
          Water pollution source tracking web application helps to track pollution sources in bodies of water, aiding in pollution control efforts which is very much essential nowadays as it is far fed on using citizens. This  application is to aware people for good health and well-being  , for clean water sanitation and  to improve water quality by reducing pollution, eliminating dumping and minimizing release of hazardous chemicals and materials, halving the proportion of untreated wastewater and substantially increasing recycling and safe reuse globally'.
