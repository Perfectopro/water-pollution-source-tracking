            <p class="p2">CAUSE OF POLLUTION</p>
            <p class="p1">More than half of the water available in Punjab is considered contaminated12. The contamination is due to hazardous chemicals, heavy metals, and radioactive material1. Even the clean and safe groundwater in the state began to get rapidly depleted, leading to a severe water crisis in Punjab1. The exact sources of these heavy metals are unclear, but experts suspect geological factors and overuse of fertilisers2. Punjab has issued tenders to build and commission community-level water-purification plants as a short-term measure</p>
            <br><br><br>
            <p class="p2">EFFECTS OF POLLUTION</p>
            <p class="p1">The pollution in Punjab’s rivers has had a significant impact on the health of the local population. The prevalence of cancer and hepatitis C is very high in the affected areas, and spontaneous abortions and premature births are also more common </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The highly polluted waters are carried through canals into the Malwa belt, where they are used extensively for irrigation and drinking purposes, leading to the highest incidence of cancer and kidney diseases in India </li>
                    <li>The pollution is due to hazardous chemicals, heavy metals, and radioactive material, and the exact sources of these heavy metals are unclear, but experts suspect geological factors and overuse of fertilisers</li>
                </ol>
            <br><br>
            <p class="p1"> To prevent pollution in Punjab’s rivers, it is important to take measures to reduce the amount of hazardous chemicals, heavy metals, and radioactive material that are released into the water. Here are some steps that can be taken to help prevent pollution:</p> <br><br>
            <ol>
                <li>Dispose of hazardous materials safely: Contact your local waste management department to dispose of hazardous waste safely. Do not pour</li>
                <li>Reduce the use of fertilizers and pesticides: These chemicals pollute rivers. Consider using organic alternatives instead </li>
                <li>Attend clean-ups: Participate in clean-up events to help remove pollutants from the water</li>
                <li>Plant trees and use mulch: Planting trees and using mulch can help prevent soil erosion, which can lead to water pollution</li>
                <li>Punjab has issued tenders to build and commission community-level water-purification plants as a short-term measure </li>
            </ol>
            <p class="p1"> However, it is important to take long-term measures to prevent pollution in        the first place.</p>
